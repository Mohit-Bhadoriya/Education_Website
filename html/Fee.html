<p>Candidates who have paid SAF for all channels of admission are considered eligible for ﬂoat option(s). However, they can withdraw their application through the application portal and get full refund till a certain date for every channel (<a href="http://www.iiseradmission.in/pdf/Dates_Rounds.pdf">check here</a>). Once a candidate withdraws the application, the seat will be considered vacant and refund will be granted as per the refund policy.</P>
<OL START=3>
<h3><li> Refund Policy:</li></H3></OL>
<h4>Refund policy for the Application Fee is as follows:</h4>
<b style="color:red">The application fee is not refundable. </b></P>
<h4> Refund policy for the Seat Acceptance Fee is as follows:</h4>
<OL TYPE=i>
<li> The withdrawal window will be available as long as allocation of that particular admission channel goes on.</li><br>
<li> If the candidate selected through KVPY/JEE/SCB channels withdraws his/her claim to a seat any time before the deadline specified by JAC, no cancellation fee will be applicable.</li>
<br><li><b style="color:red"> After the withdrawal deadline, a cancellation fee of Rs. 10000 (or Rs 5000 – for candidates of SC/ST categories) will be applicable.</b></li>
<br><li> How to withdraw your seat/oﬀer: The candidate can withdraw his/her seat/oﬀer by pressing the button “Withdraw your Seat” available on the allocation portal using their login credentials.</li>
<br><li> IISERs and JAC are not liable for losses incurred if the application is not withdrawn in the above manner and on or before the withdrawal deadline.</li>
<br><li> Withdrawal is possible ONLY online through the counselling portal until the channel-wise withdrawal deadline. No other form/method of withdrawal is accepted.</li>
<br><li> Once the candidate has withdrawn the oﬀer through the counselling portal, the amount due will be returned to the credit card, debit card or the bank account, which was used to pay the SAF. Such candidates do not have to take any additional steps towards their SAF refund. Refund process would start in parallel to allocation but may take 2-3 weeks for the money to be refunded.</li>
<br><li> If the candidate fails to join in person, (or through the online mode as specified by the concerned IISER) on the joining date mentioned in the oﬀer letter of the respective IISER, the cancellation fee decided by the concerned IISER will be applicable. Further, candidates who have paid SAF but fail to show up by the last date of admission fee payment at the concerned IISER will not be considered for further rounds of admission. Also, such candidates will be debarred from admission to IISERs (for BS-MS and/or BS programmes) in the future.</li>
